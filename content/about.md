## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about learning and exploring various domains in technology and computer science. This blog is a collection of my projects, code snippets, and notes on different topics I've been diving into. It serves as both a portfolio and a learning journal, showcasing my journey as I expand my skills and knowledge.

## Things I Have Learned

Here's a quick overview of some key areas I've been focusing on:

### Programming Languages

**Java**: Core Java concepts, object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.

**Python**: Data analysis, web scraping, automation scripts, and machine learning basics.

**JavaScript**: Frontend development with frameworks like React, and backend with Node.js.

### Web Development

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.

**Backend**: Node.js, Express, RESTful API design, and working with databases like MongoDB and SQL.

**Full Stack Projects**: Building complete web applications from scratch.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

- Mastery of fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, hash tables)
- Problem-solving with algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms)
- Algorithmic complexity analysis (Big O notation)

### DevOps and Tools

- Version control with Git and GitHub
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Containerization with Docker

### Software Development Practices

- Writing clean, maintainable code with best practices
- Test-driven development (TDD) and unit testing using frameworks like JUnit and PyTest
- Agile methodologies and project management tools like Jira and Trello
